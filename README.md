# philosophersDinner
It is a task about philosophers, who eat behind the round table
Every of them has one plate and two forks.
But they need to eat using two forks.
Thats why in the moment when philosopher eats, his neightbour can't do that.
It is need to feed all philosophers, without problems.

I used there ReetrantLocks, from java.concurent.
